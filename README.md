## About the Project

This repository demonstrates how AI models can enhance cybersecurity efforts, including:

- Phishing detection
- Network anomaly detection
- Real-time threat monitoring

The examples utilize Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts with preprocessed datasets to showcase these applications.

---

## Prerequisites

To follow along, you need:

1. A Google account to access [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Basic familiarity with Python and machine learning concepts.
3. An internet connection to download datasets and run cloud-based notebooks.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShaikhaTheGreen/AI_n_Cybersecurity.git
   ```

2. **Explore the Content**:
   Open the `notebooks` folder to browse Jupyter notebooks and their corresponding descriptions.

## Running the Examples in Google Colab

You can run all the examples on Google Colab without needing to set up a local Python environment. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Open the Notebook in Google Colab

1. Navigate to the `notebooks` folder in this repository.
2. Click on any `.ipynb` file you wish to run (e.g., `Network_Traffic_for_Anomaly_Detection.ipynb`).
3. In the GitHub preview, click the **"Open in Colab"** button at the top (or copy the notebook URL and open it directly in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)).

### Step 2: Connect to Google Colab Runtime

1. Click **"Connect"** in the top-right corner of the Colab interface to connect to a free GPU/CPU runtime.
2. Verify that the runtime is active by checking the status indicator.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Run the first cell in the notebook to install the required Python packages. For example:
```python
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Download Datasets

Datasets are hosted in the `datasets` folder. Use the `wget` or `gdown` command to download them into your Colab environment. Example:
```python
!wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShaikhaTheGreen/AI_n_Cybersecurity/main/datasets/network_traffic.csv
```

### Step 5: Execute the Code

Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to:

- Preprocess the data.
- Train AI models.
- Visualize the results.

### Step 6: Save Your Work

Save the notebook and results back to your Google Drive or local machine as needed.
